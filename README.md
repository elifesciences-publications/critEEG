# critEEG
MATLAB analysis code for Niels A. Kloosterman, Jan Willem de Gee, Markus Werkle-Bergner, Ulman Lindenberger, Douglas D. Garrett, Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort 2018. Humans strategically shift decision bias by flexibly adjusting sensory evidence accumulation in visual cortex.

The master script is run_critEEGanalysis, from which the analysis functions are called. The fieldtrip toolbox should be installed.
